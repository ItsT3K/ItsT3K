Howdy, Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm ItsT3K. My code goes on here which is neat. I don't know what more to post so.

I'm just a Linux/Unix user. I like to code and work on electronics. I also do audio stuff. 
My pronouns are He/Him.

My profile photo is of a ASCII art version of the character Chen from the Touhou series of games.
I've had this profile pic here for years and I am too lazy to change it. Plus I really don't want
to anyways.
